# Enhanced Features Summary

## Overview
Transformed the bachelor party app with rich, database-driven content management for activities and event information.

## What's New

### 1. **Enhanced Activities System**

Activities are now rich objects with:
- **Icon** - Visual icon from lucide-react library (70+ options)
- **Title & Description** - Rich text descriptions
- **When** - Both human-readable time (e.g., "Saturday Morning") and exact datetime
- **Location** - Where the activity takes place
- **Cost** - Numeric cost + descriptive text (e.g., "$50 (includes drinks)")
- **Additional Notes** - Extra information for guests
- **Answer Options** - Customizable participation levels

### 2. **Dynamic Event Info Page** (`/info`)

The `/info` page now loads all content from the database:
- Event name, dates, description
- Location with Google Maps integration
- Accommodation details
- Timeline/schedule with visual timeline
- Important information sections
- Beautiful, document-style presentation

Admins can edit everything via the Admin Dashboard!

### 3. **Enhanced Admin Dashboard**

#### Activities Management Tab:
- Beautiful form with icon picker
- Set when, where, cost for each activity
- Visual preview of how activities will appear
- Quick edit mode for updates

#### Event Info Tab:
- Edit event details
- Manage schedule items
- Update important information
- All changes reflect immediately on `/info` page

## Files Created/Modified

### Database Migrations:
1. **`database/admin-features-migration-safe.sql`** - Initial admin features (safe to re-run)
2. **`database/enhance-activities-and-info.sql`** - Enhanced fields for activities and event info

### New Components:
1. **`components/icon-selector.tsx`** - Icon picker with 70+ icons
2. **`components/activities-manager-enhanced.tsx`** - Rich activity editor
3. **`components/admin-settings.tsx`** - Password management
4. **`components/event-info-editor.tsx`** - Event information editor

### Updated Pages:
1. **`app/admin/page.tsx`** - Now with 5 tabs (RSVPs, Guests, Activities, Event Info, Settings)
2. **`app/info/page.tsx`** - Dynamic, database-driven event information page

### Updated Types:
- **`lib/supabase.ts`** - Added all new types for enhanced features

### API Routes Created:
- `/api/admin/password/check` - Check if admin has password
- `/api/admin/password/set` - Set/update admin password
- `/api/event-info` - GET/PUT event information
- `/api/activities` - GET/POST activities
- `/api/activities/[id]` - PUT/DELETE specific activity

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run First Migration (If Not Done)

```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
-- Run: database/admin-features-migration-safe.sql
```

This creates:
- `admin_passwords` table
- `event_info` table
- `activities` table
- `activity_signups.activity_id` column
- All necessary RLS policies

### Step 2: Run Enhancement Migration

```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
-- Run: database/enhance-activities-and-info.sql
```

This adds:
- Icon, when, cost, location fields to activities
- Schedule and important_info fields to event_info
- Sample data for existing activities

### Step 3: Use the Admin Dashboard

1. Navigate to `/admin`
2. Log in with admin credentials
3. Go to **Settings** tab and set your password
4. Go to **Event Info** tab and update event details
5. Go to **Activities** tab and enhance existing activities (add icons, costs, etc.)

### Step 4: View the Results

- Visit `/info` to see the beautiful event information page
- Visit `/activities` to see enhanced activity cards (coming next!)

## What's Still TODO

### 1. Enhanced `/activities` Page

Need to update the activities page to:
- Show activity icons
- Display when, where, cost information
- Show signup counts for each option
- Make it more visually appealing

### 2. API for Signup Counts

Create an endpoint to get signup counts per activity option:
```typescript
GET /api/activities/[id]/signups
// Returns: { "participating": 12, "watching": 5, "not_attending": 3 }
```

### 3. Rich Text Editor (Future Enhancement)

For truly WYSIWYG editing of event descriptions, consider adding:
- TipTap or Lexical editor
- Store rich content as JSON in `event_info.rich_description`
- Render with proper formatting

## Key Features

### Icon Selector
- 70+ icons to choose from
- Search functionality
- Visual picker interface
- Icons include: Trophy, Target, Ticket, Beer, Wine, Music, Gamepad2, and many more

### Admin Password Management
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt
- Individual password per admin
- Falls back to environment variable if not set
- Change password anytime in Settings

### Event Information Management
- Single source of truth in database
- Schedule with visual timeline
- Important info in grid layout
- Google Maps integration

### Activities Management
- Create unlimited activities
- Each activity is a rich object
- Customizable participation options
- Visual previews in admin panel

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Database-Driven?
- **Flexibility**: Add/remove activities without code changes
- **Non-technical editing**: Admins don't need to edit code
- **Consistency**: Single source of truth
- **Scalability**: Easy to add more fields later

### Why Separate Tables?
- **Activities**: Reusable, can have many signups
- **Event Info**: Single record, global information
- **Activity Signups**: Links users to activities

### Icon Storage
- Store icon name as string (e.g., "Trophy")
- Dynamically load from lucide-react
- Fallback to default if icon not found

## Security

- RLS policies ensure only admins can edit
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (10 rounds)
- HTTP-only session cookies
- Admin verification on all write operations

## Performance Considerations

- Event info cached on client after first load
- Activities fetched once per page load
- Icons loaded from local library (no external requests)
- Optimistic UI updates in admin panel

## Future Enhancements

1. **Rich Text Editor** - WYSIWYG editing for descriptions
2. **Image Uploads** - Activity images, event photos
3. **Activity Categories** - Group activities by type
4. **Capacity Limits** - Set max participants per activity
5. **Waitlists** - Automatic waitlist when activity is full
6. **Email Notifications** - Notify when activity details change
7. **iCal Export** - Download schedule to calendar

## Support

If you run into issues:
1. Check Supabase logs for database errors
2. Check browser console for frontend errors
3. Verify migrations ran successfully
4. Ensure admin user has correct role
